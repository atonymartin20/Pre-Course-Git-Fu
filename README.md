## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A collection of commits that uses branches and tags to identify commits.
 * Git - Version Control - The system that records every set of changes and stores a record of changes to files in the repository.
    This way each version can be restored in case of coding errors or deletions.
 * Clone - An exact copy of an existing repository.
 * Fork - A copy of the original code that can be edited without affecting the original code.
 * History - The full history of the different commits that were made through the repository.
 * Staging - The location that files are stored before being committed to the repository.
 * Remote - A repository that is not stored on the current computer but is stored elsewhere.
 * Commit - The process of recording changes made to the current repository.
 * Push - The process of sending committed changes to a repository.  This updates the files to allow others to use or edit them as well.

## Steps to our Lambda School Git Flow
1. Fork repository
2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
